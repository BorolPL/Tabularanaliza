* [Download Tabular Editor v. 2.7.1 for SQL Server 2016, 2017 or Azure Analysis Services](https://github.com/otykier/TabularEditor/releases/latest)

### Prerequisites
Tabular Editor uses the [Tabular Object Model](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt706505.aspx) to load and save metadata to and from Model.bim files or existing databases. For this reason, make sure you have the latest AMO libraries available before installing Tabular Editor. They can be downloaded from the [SQL Server 2017 Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=829578). The .msi installer will prompt you to download these, if you do not already have them.
